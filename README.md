# Minto: Productivity Gamified by the Minute

## About

Minto is a Chrome extension that gamifies productivity, inspired by the Pomodoro technique. Earn a mint for every minute you work, and spend mints on rewards that you create. Block distracting sites like Reddit or YouTube while you work, and also use the gamified to-do list and habit list to gamify your productivity even more.

## Features

- customizable work session timers
- website blocking while working
- gamified to-do list and habit list (completing a to-do removes it, completing a habit crosses it out for the day)
- customizable rewards using mints
- right-click in Chrome to block a specific site
- toggle to show notifications in Control Center
- keyboard shortcuts to start and pause work sessions (Ctrl+S to open popup, Ctrl+D to start/pause a session)
