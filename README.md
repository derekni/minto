## About

Minto is a Chrome extension that gamifies productivity, inspired by the Pomodoro technique. Earn a mint for every minute you work, and spend mints on rewards that you create. Block distracting sites like Reddit or YouTube while you work, and also use the gamified to-do list and habit list to gamify your productivity even more. Download on the [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/minto/hcgkjlalkeaekjkelpilagbjcengeebl).
